// console.log("Http request");

// AJAX - Asynchronous Javascript And XML
//but no one work with xml now a days its json now,
//we will get response in json.

//back then (for example mdn docs) we communicate with server by reloading the page.
//requesting a new content will basically bring up entirely a new page.
//browser is requesting for a new webpage.
//mdn server will for example compiles new webpage for us.

//but ajax is different, where page never reloads, request or communication with the server happens in the background, and based on the request data or elements in the page will change, more like single page application.

//ajax will help communication with the server behind the scenes, not between the page loads.
