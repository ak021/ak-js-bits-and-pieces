## SetTimeout() trust issues

> - setTimeout doesnt give the guarantee that it will execute right after the timer expires
> - instead it says , it says, callback function will get executed anytime after the timer expires, may be immediately, some times it may not,

## setTimeout(0)

> ```js
> console.log("start");
>
> setTimeout(() => {
>   console.log("inside callback func");
> }, 0);
>
> console.log("end");
>
> // output will be..
> // start
> // end
> // inside callback func
> ```

> #### explanation: though the timer is 0, setTimeout passes the callback to the web API environment, now inorder for the call back to be executed it needs to be pushed to the call stack. but call stack will have GEC, and GEC will be removed at the end of the program.

> #### though the timer is 0, it wont execute the callback immediately.
