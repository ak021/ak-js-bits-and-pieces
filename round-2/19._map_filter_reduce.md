## map() filter() and reduce()

---

### map() :

> **The map function is a higher-order function that takes an array and applies a given transformation function to each element of the array. It creates a new array with the results of applying the transformation function to each element. The map function does not modify the original array.**

## reduce():

> The reduce function is a higher-order function that reduces an array to a single value by applying a combining function to each element of the array. It takes an initial value and the combining function, which accumulates the result at each step. The reduce function can be used to perform various operations like summing elements, finding maximum or minimum values, or any custom computation.

> ```js
> array.reduce(reducingFunction, initialValue);
> ```
