## undefined vs not defined

### undefined

> **When javascript allocate the memory for a variable declared by var keyword, it will give a placeholder that is undefined**

### difference between undefined and null

> <span style="color:red;font-size:16px">undefined:</span>
>
> - **undefined is a primitive(check misc) value that is automatically assigned to a declared variable that has not been assigned a value.**
> - undefined is a primitive value in JavaScript that is automatically assigned to a variable when it is declared but not initialized with a value. It is also the default value returned by a function if no explicit return value is specified. For example:
> - <span style="color:red;font-size:16px">null:</span>
> - On the other hand, null is a special value in JavaScript that represents the <span style="color:lime;font-size:16px">intentional absence</span> of any object value. It is often assigned explicitly by a programmer to indicate that a variable or object property has no value or is empty.
