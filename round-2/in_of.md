In JavaScript, the `for...in` and `for...of` loops are used to iterate over different types of collections. Here's an explanation of their differences and common use cases:

1. `for...in` loop:

   - The `for...in` loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object.
   - It is primarily used to iterate over the keys (property names) of an object.
   - It can also be used to iterate over the indices of an array, but it's not recommended because it may not iterate in the expected order, and it may include additional enumerable properties inherited from the object's prototype chain.
   - Example usage:

     ```javascript
     const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

     for (let key in obj) {
       console.log(key); // prints 'a', 'b', 'c'
       console.log(obj[key]); // prints 1, 2, 3
     }
     ```

2. `for...of` loop:

   - The `for...of` loop iterates over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.
   - It provides a simpler syntax compared to the `for...in` loop and directly gives access to the values of the collection rather than the keys.
   - It can't be used with regular objects (plain key-value pairs) because they are not iterable by default.
   - Example usage:

     ```javascript
     const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

     for (let value of arr) {
       console.log(value); // prints 1, 2, 3, 4
     }
     ```

     ```javascript
     const str = "Hello";

     for (let char of str) {
       console.log(char); // prints 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'
     }
     ```

In summary, use the `for...in` loop when you need to iterate over the keys of an object, and use the `for...of` loop when you want to iterate over the values of an iterable collection like an array or a string.
