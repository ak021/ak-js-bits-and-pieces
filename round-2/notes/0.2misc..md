### MAP

> **The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.**

In JavaScript, `Map` is a built-in data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs. It is similar to an object, but with some important differences. Here are the key features and use cases of `Map`:

1. Key-Value Pair Storage:

   - `Map` stores data as key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
   - Unlike objects, `Map` allows any value to be used as a key, including objects, functions, and primitive data types.
   - This makes `Map` suitable for scenarios where you need more flexibility in key types or when you want to preserve the insertion order of the key-value pairs.

2. Iteration and Size:

   - `Map` maintains the order of inserted elements, making it suitable for scenarios where the order of key-value pairs matters.
   - It provides built-in methods to iterate over the keys, values, or entries (key-value pairs) of the `Map`, such as `forEach`, `for...of` loop, and the `entries` method.
   - You can also get the size of a `Map` using the `size` property.

3. Methods and Operations:

   - `Map` provides methods for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting key-value pairs, including `set`, `get`, `has`, `delete`, and `clear`.
   - The `set` method allows you to add or update a key-value pair in the `Map`.
   - The `get` method retrieves the value associated with a specified key.
   - The `has` method checks if a key exists in the `Map`.
   - The `delete` method removes a key-value pair from the `Map`.
   - The `clear` method removes all key-value pairs from the `Map`.

4. Use Cases:
   - Storing and retrieving data with a specific key, such as caching computed values.
   - Maintaining the order of elements, such as tracking the order of events or maintaining a history.
   - Handling complex key types, such as using objects as keys to associate additional data with an object.
   - Grouping related data, such as storing metadata or options associated with an object.

Here's an example usage of `Map`:

```javascript
const myMap = new Map();

// Adding key-value pairs
myMap.set("name", "John");
myMap.set("age", 30);
myMap.set({ id: 1 }, "Some data"); //object can be a key

// Retrieving values
console.log(myMap.get("name")); // Output: 'John'
console.log(myMap.get("age")); // Output: 30

// Checking if a key exists
console.log(myMap.has("name")); // Output: true
console.log(myMap.has("occupation")); // Output: false

// Iterating over keys
for (let key of myMap.keys()) {
  console.log(key);
}

// Iterating over values
for (let value of myMap.values()) {
  console.log(value);
}

// Iterating over entries (key-value pairs)
for (let entry of myMap.entries()) {
  console.log(entry);
}

// Getting the size of the Map
console.log(myMap.size); // Output: 3

// Deleting a key-value pair
myMap.delete("age");

// Clearing the Map
myMap.clear();
```

Overall, `Map` provides a powerful and flexible way to store and manipulate key-value pairs in JavaScript, offering features that make it useful in various scenarios.

## SET

> In JavaScript, `Set` is a built-in data structure that represents a collection of unique values. It allows you to store and retrieve distinct values, ensuring that each value appears only once within the `Set`. Here's an explanation of the features and common use cases of `Set`:

1. Unique Values:

   - The main purpose of a `Set` is to store unique values. It guarantees that each value can occur only once within the `Set`.
   - When adding values to a `Set`, it checks for uniqueness based on the value's identity using the SameValueZero algorithm, which means that it considers `NaN` values to be the same and treats `-0` and `+0` as distinct values.

2. Iteration and Size:

   - `Set` maintains the order of inserted elements, making it suitable for scenarios where the order of values matters.
   - It provides built-in methods to iterate over the values in the `Set`, such as `forEach` and the `for...of` loop.
   - You can also get the size (number of unique values) of a `Set` using the `size` property.

3. Methods and Operations:

   - `Set` provides methods for adding, deleting, and checking the presence of values, including `add`, `delete`, `has`, and `clear`.
   - The `add` method allows you to add a new unique value to the `Set`.
   - The `delete` method removes a value from the `Set`.
   - The `has` method checks if a value exists in the `Set`.
   - The `clear` method removes all values from the `Set`.

4. Use Cases:
   - Eliminating duplicates from an array or any other collection by converting it to a `Set` and then converting it back to an array if needed.
   - Checking for the existence of a particular value without worrying about duplicates.
   - Implementing algorithms or logic that requires storing and manipulating a unique set of values.
   - Performing set operations such as union, intersection, and difference between multiple sets.

Here's an example usage of `Set`:

```javascript
const mySet = new Set();

// Adding values
mySet.add(1);
mySet.add("Hello");
mySet.add(true);
mySet.add(1); // Ignored, already present

// Checking values
console.log(mySet.has(1)); // Output: true
console.log(mySet.has("World")); // Output: false

// Iterating over values
mySet.forEach((value) => {
  console.log(value);
});

// Getting the size of the Set
console.log(mySet.size); // Output: 3

// Deleting a value
mySet.delete(true);

// Clearing the Set
mySet.clear();
```

In this example, the `Set` called `mySet` is used to store unique values. The `add` method is used to add values, the `has` method is used to check if a value exists, and the `delete` method is used to remove a value. The `forEach` method is used to iterate over the values of the `Set`, and the `size` property is used to get the number of values in the `Set`.

`Set` provides a convenient way to handle collections of unique values, ensuring simplicity and efficiency in scenarios where uniqueness is a requirement.

## WeakMap

Imagine you have objects, and you want to associate additional information or data with those objects. You could use a regular Map for this purpose, but there's a catch: if you later remove or no longer use those objects, the associated data won't be automatically removed from the Map. This can lead to memory leaks, where unused objects and their associated data continue to occupy memory.

Here's where WeakMap comes in. It solves this problem by allowing you to associate data with objects while not preventing the objects from being garbage collected when they're no longer used elsewhere in your code.

In a WeakMap, the keys are weakly referenced. This means that if there are no other references to a key object, it can be automatically garbage collected, and the corresponding key-value pair will be removed from the WeakMap as well. This ensures that you don't hold onto objects longer than necessary, allowing for better memory management.

## WEAKSET

`WeakSet` is similar to `Set`, but it holds weak references to objects instead of values. Here's an explanation of `WeakSet` and its usage:

1. Weak References:

   - In a `WeakSet`, the values can only be objects, and the references to those objects are held weakly.
   - Weak references mean that if there are no other references to an object, it may be garbage collected, and the corresponding value will be automatically removed from the `WeakSet`.

2. Garbage Collection:

   - `WeakSet` allows objects to be garbage collected when they're no longer used elsewhere in your code.
   - When an object in a `WeakSet` becomes unreachable from other parts of your code, it becomes eligible for garbage collection, and the corresponding value is automatically removed from the `WeakSet`.

3. Unique Values:

   - `WeakSet` ensures that each object can appear only once in the set.
   - If you attempt to add the same object multiple times to a `WeakSet`, it will be considered as a single entry.

4. Methods and Operations:

   - `WeakSet` provides methods for adding, deleting, and checking the presence of objects, including `add`, `delete`, and `has`.
   - The `add` method is used to add an object to the `WeakSet`.
   - The `delete` method removes an object from the `WeakSet`.
   - The `has` method checks if an object exists in the `WeakSet`.

5. Use Cases:
   - Managing a collection of objects that should only exist as long as they are used elsewhere in your code.
   - Tracking weak references to objects without preventing them from being garbage collected.
   - Building efficient caches or data structures that automatically release resources when they're no longer needed.

Here's an example usage of `WeakSet`:

```javascript
const weakSet = new WeakSet();

const obj1 = {};
const obj2 = {};

// Adding objects to the WeakSet
weakSet.add(obj1);
weakSet.add(obj2);

// Checking existence of objects
console.log(weakSet.has(obj1)); // Output: true
console.log(weakSet.has(obj2)); // Output: true

// Removing an object
weakSet.delete(obj2);
```

In this example, `WeakSet` is used to store objects (`obj1` and `obj2`) as weak references. The `add` method is used to add objects to the `WeakSet`, the `has` method checks if an object exists, and the `delete` method removes an object from the `WeakSet`.

`WeakSet` is useful when you want to maintain a collection of objects but don't want to prevent them from being garbage collected when they're no longer used. It's commonly used for scenarios where weak references are desired, such as managing temporary or auxiliary object associations.
