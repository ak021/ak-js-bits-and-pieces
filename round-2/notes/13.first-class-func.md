## Deep diving into functions

### what is first class function?

> **_In JavaScript, first-class functions refer to the concept that functions are treated as values and can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions._**
>
> **_A first-class function is a function that can be treated like any other <span style="color:lime;">value</span> in a programming language. This means that functions can be:_**
>
> - Assigned to variables
> - Passed as arguments to other functions
> - Returned from other functions
> - Stored in data structures like array

### 1. Function statement

> ```js
> // this is a functional statement
> function sayHello() {
>   console.log("Hello there");
> }
> ```

### 2. function expression

> ```js
> const sayHello = function () {
>   console.log("say hello");
> };
> ```

### 3. what is the difference between function statemenet and function expression?

> **_The main difference between function statement and function expression is_**
>
> - function statement are hoisted,
>
> ```js
> // if we call these two functions before initialization
> //function which is a function expression will through an error.
> a();
> b(); // TypeError: 'b' is not a function
>
> //func statement
> function a() {
>   console.log("this is a");
> }
>
> // func expression
> // here this is an anonymous function expression
> var b = function () {
>   console.log("this is b");
> };
> ```

### 3. Named function expression.

> ```js
> // when we gave name to the function then it become,  named function expression.
>
> var c = function sayHello() {
>   console.log("named function expression");
> };
>
> //but there is a gotcha
> sayHello();
> // this will throw an error, we can't call the function directly.
> // sayHello is not part of the global scope,
> // error: Uncaught reference error, sayHello is not defined;
> ```
