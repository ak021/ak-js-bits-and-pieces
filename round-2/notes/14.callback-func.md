> - _**Functions are first class citizens in js, meaning we can pass function to another function, the function which you passed is callback function.**_

## event listeners and closures

- How to attach a count tracker,
  - using a global scope. (not a good practice)
  - using closure as below
    > ```js
    > function attachClickEventListener() {
    >   let count = 0;
    >   const btn = document.getElementById("submit");
    >   btn.addEventListener("click", function abc() {
    >     console.log("btn clicked", count);
    >   });
    > }
    > ```

## Why is it important to remove an event listener?

> **_event listeners are kinda heavy, it takes memory._**
>
> - **_it forms a closure, which will fill up memory_**
> - **_it leads to memory leak, so it is important to clean the event listener when they are not needed_**
