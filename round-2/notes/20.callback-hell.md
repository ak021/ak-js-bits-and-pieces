## Callback

## Calback hell

Callback hell, also known as the pyramid of doom, is a term used to describe a situation in JavaScript where multiple nested callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations. It occurs when you have asynchronous operations that depend on each other, leading to deeply nested callback functions.

> ```js
> asyncOperation1(arg1, (result1) => {
>   asyncOperation2(arg2, (result2) => {
>     asyncOperation3(arg3, (result3) => {
>       // Do something with result1, result2, and result3
>     });
>   });
> });
> ```

## Promises

> - promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in javascript.
> -     In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It provides a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more structured and manageable manner.
