## Promises

---

> **A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations such as making network requests, reading/writing files, or interacting with databases.**  

A promise can be in one of three states:

1. **Pending**: This is the initial state when a promise is created, and it represents that the operation is still in progress and hasn't completed yet.

2. **Fulfilled**: When the asynchronous operation is successful and the promise is resolved, it enters the fulfilled state. At this point, the promise has a resulting value associated with it.

3. **Rejected**: If an error occurs during the asynchronous operation, the promise enters the rejected state. The promise's associated error or reason for rejection is available.

Promises provide a way to handle the results of asynchronous operations in a more structured and predictable manner. Rather than relying on traditional callback functions, promises allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together, making the code easier to read and reason about.

Here's an example of creating and using a promise in JavaScript:

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Perform an asynchronous operation
  // For example, make an HTTP request
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open("GET", "https://api.example.com/data");

  request.onload = () => {
    if (request.status === 200) {
      // Resolve the promise with the response data
      resolve(request.response);
    } else {
      // Reject the promise with an error message
      reject("Error: Unable to fetch data");
    }
  };

  request.send();
});

// Using the promise
myPromise
  .then((data) => {
    // Handle the fulfilled state
    console.log("Data:", data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle the rejected state
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });
```

In this example, the promise represents an HTTP request. If the request is successful, the promise is resolved with the response data. Otherwise, it is rejected with an error message. The `.then()` method is used to handle the fulfilled state, and the `.catch()` method is used to handle the rejected state.

Promises are an integral part of JavaScript's asynchronous programming model and are widely used in modern JavaScript applications.
