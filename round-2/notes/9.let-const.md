## let and const (Temporal dead zone);

### <span style="color:aqua;">Is <span style="color:lime;">let</span> and <span style="color:lime;">const</span> are hoisted in javascript?</span>

### YES.

> - _**In JavaScript, both let and const declarations are hoisted, but there is a difference in how they are hoisted compared to var declarations.**_  
>   _**variables with var are hosited and attached to the global space, where as variables declared with let are hoisted but attached to a differenct space**_ > _**we cant access the variables declated with let and const before initialization, it will through you an error saying <span style="color:red;">Uncaught ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'a' before initialization</span>**_

### <span style="color:aqua;">Temporal dead zone</span>

> - **_the time between a let and const variables are hoisted and till it is initialized, that time zone is called <span style="color: lime;">temporal dead zone</span>._**
> - _**In more technical terms, the TDZ is the period from the start of the scope (block or function) until the variable's declaration is reached in the execution flow. During this period, any attempt to access the variable will throw an error.**_

> <span style="color:red;">**Syntax error**</span> : initializing a const variable without value
>
> ```js
> const b;
> ```

> <span style="color:red;">**Type error**</span> : assignment to constant variable.
>
> ```js
> // here variable be is type of const, we are trying to
> //reassign a value to a const variable, which results in
> //Type error
> const b = 100;
> b = 2000;
> ```

> <span style="color:red;">**Reference error**</span> :
> when js engine try to access a variable in the memory space, but it is not able to access it.
>
> ```js
> console.log(a);

## Block scope and shadowing

> - let and const are block scoped.

> - **_what is the use of block in the first place_**
>   we can group multiple statement together in a block,so that we can use it in places where js expects one single statement
>
> ```js
> if (true) do something
> // here in do something javascript expects a single statement
> // but what if we need to do multiple this if condition is true?
> // here comes the block, js consider this block as one statement
> ```
>
> - also for scope
> - group related statements together

### Shadowing

> ```js
> var b = 2345;
> {
>   let a = 100;
>   var b = 200;
>   const c = 300;
>   console.log(b);
>   // here b is printed as 200, because inner 'b' shadows outer 'b'
> }
> console.log(b);
> ```

## illegal shadowing

> ```js
> let a = 20;
> {
>   var a = 20;
>   // since var is function scoped, it will conflict with the let a, and through an error;
>   //Syntax Error: Identifier a has already  been declared
> }
> ```
